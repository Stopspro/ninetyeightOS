# ninetyeightOS
ninetyeightOS is a fully functional, lightweight terminal OS.
The goal of the project is to create a free OS that can run multiple coding languages, games, and apps using open-source programs like Wine.
# Compatible Programs
ninetyeightOS is currently compatible with no programs, because it is in VERY early stages. However, support for the following programs is planned, alongside many more:
  
CPUMiner

Doom (original)

Minetest

Wine
